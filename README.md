Comparison of Finite difference discretisations of the Convection- Diffusion equation 1D
========================================================================================
In this codes, we discretize the Convection- Diffusion
-epsilon y'' + y' = 2
[0,1] with y(0) = y(1) = 0, using Finite difference
 
ex0.m using central difference,
ex1.m using backward difference,
